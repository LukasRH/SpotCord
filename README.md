## Discord Hackweek
This bot was made during Discord's hackweek as my submission. It was created for as often when listening along with people on spotify you might want to share a song or just collaboratively with your friends choose what to listen too.

SpotCord allows people to queue up songs on the host's spotify, removing the hazel from the host, which can just lay back and enjoy the music.
